## About Us

We are dedicated to providing exceptional service and innovative solutions on the **Stellar blockchain**. Our mission is to empower users, developers, and creators by making token issuance and distribution transparent, accessible, and decentralized.

Our team is passionate about helping you achieve your financial goals through **decentralized technology**, open collaboration, and community trust. Every token listed on SiteHub is backed by a **public GitHub repository**, ensuring:

✅ Full transparency  
✅ Perpetual availability  
✅ Open-source verification  
✅ Community auditability  

By leveraging GitHub as a decentralized hosting platform, we ensure that no single entity controls the token data — it's owned by the community, forever.

## Features

✨ **Discover Tokens** – Browse a curated list of Stellar-based tokens (credit alphanum assets) hosted on public GitHub repos.  
🔐 **Trustless & Transparent** – All token details (name, logo, domain, policies) are version-controlled and publicly verifiable.  
🌱 **Community-Driven** – Anyone can contribute or launch a token following our open standards.  
🔄 **Always Up-to-Date** – Changes are pulled directly from GitHub, ensuring real-time accuracy.

## How It Works

1. Token issuers create a public GitHub repository with a standardized `token.json` manifest.
2. The repository includes logo, description, website, and other metadata.
3. SiteHub indexes these repos, making tokens discoverable across Stellar wallets and exchanges.
4. Users can view, verify, and interact with tokens directly on StellarTerm or any compatible wallet.
